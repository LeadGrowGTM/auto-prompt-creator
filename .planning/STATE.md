# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-31)

**Core value:** A prompt produced by this system makes a cheap model (Haiku) produce outputs indistinguishable from a powerful model (Opus) for a specific, defined task.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Scenario Foundation + Ground Truth

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Scenario Foundation + Ground Truth)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-30 — Roadmap created

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- SIMBA-style self-reflective mutation over evolutionary/population-based approaches
- LLM judge (Opus) over deterministic scoring for semantic equivalence
- Claude Code as sole runtime (zero external API cost)
- Dynamic schema per scenario (fields defined by prompt, not hardcoded)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Haiku agent spawning mechanics need empirical validation in Phase 2
- Judge noise floor with Opus needs measurement before optimization loop runs
- Optimal train/validation split for tiny datasets (5-10 examples) needs testing
